## Blender add-on 
An open source add-on in blender to facilitate design of orthopaedic aids.

### Getting started 
It is recommended to use an external IDE for edititing the source code. A suitable editor is 
Visual Studio Code with the [Blender Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JacquesLucke.blender-development)

### Naming conventions 
We use the conventions proposed by Blender: [Blender 2.80: Addon API](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Reference/Release_Notes/2.80/Python_API/Addons)
